00	Now, let’s assume that a strange three-dimensional sphere 
04	comes into flatland. 

06	First, this sphere hovers over Flat Penguin’s house, 
11	unnoticed by the occupant. 

14	Second, it enters flat house. 

18	We, as the external observers, 
21	see that it is a three-dimensional sphere,
24	but how does Flat Penguin see this sphere?

28	Flat penguin sees only a cross section of the sphere,
33	which is a circle! 

35	As the sphere moves up and down,
38	Flat Penguin sees different slices through the sphere,
42	thus the circle changes in size.

46	Flat penguin sees a mysterious circle 
49	appearing in its house that changes its size,
55	and must think it has lost its mind.
