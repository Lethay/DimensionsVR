1-WelcomeToFlatland
00	Welcome to Flatland!

02	In this land, all objects are perfectly flat.  

2-Populated
00	This land is populated by triangles, circles, squares, 
05	and an exceptionally flat penguin!

3-FlatPenguin
00	Flat Penguin lives in its house,
03	which is separated by perfectly flat walls from the outside. 

4-MovementObjects
00	None of the flat objects can enter the house 
03	because they can only walk left and right 
06	and forth and back but not upwards or downwards.

5-SphereAppearing
00	Now, let’s assume that a strange three-dimensional sphere 
04	comes into flatland. 

06	First, this sphere hovers over Flat Penguin’s house, 
11	unnoticed by the occupant. 

14	Second, it enters flat house. 

18	We, as the external observers, 
21	see that it is a three-dimensional sphere,
24	but how does Flat Penguin see this sphere?

28	Flat penguin sees only a cross section of the sphere,
33	which is a circle! 

35	As the sphere moves up and down,
38	Flat Penguin sees different slices through the sphere,
42	thus the circle changes in size.

46	Flat penguin sees a mysterious circle 
49	appearing in its house that changes its size,
55	and must think it has lost its mind. 

6-4DAttack
00	Now imagine us living in a three-dimensional space
05	as a version of flatland:
08	for us, the appearance of a four-dimensional object
12	would look similar to the appearance of the sphere for Flat Penguin: 
17	a three-dimensional object that magically changes its size.
