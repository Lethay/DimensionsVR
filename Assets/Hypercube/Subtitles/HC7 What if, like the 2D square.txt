00	What if, like the 2D square living in a 3D world that we saw earlier, 
05	this 3D cube was living inside a 4D world? 

10	We would then be able to rotate the cube in 4D space,
14	as you can see now. 

16	Do you remember the way that rotating the square earlier
19	made its shadow appear to turn inside out?

23	Here, you can see the same effect. 
27	This cube isn’t really turning inside out 
30	– it’s rotating through a higher dimension that we can’t see!
