00	Now let’s take a look at a 3D cube.

04	We can think of a cube as being two parallel squares,
08	joined at each edge by four more squares. 

12	Notice how in the projection of the cube on the back wall, 
16	the furthest face of the cube looks smaller than the closest one.

22	If we could see only the shadow, we might guess the faces were different sizes 
27	– instead, they’re just different distances apart in the third dimension.
