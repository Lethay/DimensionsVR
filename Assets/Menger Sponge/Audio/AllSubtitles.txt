1_IntroAndLine
00	In this exhibition, you’ve seen a way that dimensions can be defined
04	in terms of the number of possible directions there are to move. 

09	But mathematically there are different ways of 
12	describing the idea of a dimension. 

15	One of them, the “fractal” dimension, 
18	uses the way that objects scale to define their dimension.

23	Here, we consider how many identical smaller copies of a shape are 
27	needed to recreate the original shape.

31	The equation you can see now describes this relationship.

35	The number of smaller copies needed 
38	is the same as the factor we have shrunk the shape by, 
42	raised to the power of the dimension 
45	– that is 2 for two dimensions, 3 for three dimensions
49	and so on and so forth. 

52	If a shape can be recreated from smaller copies of itself,
57	we can use this equation to find the fractal dimension.

61	Take this straight line, for example. 

64	Lines, as you have seen earlier in the exhibition, are one dimensional. 

69	If we shrink this one-dimensional line by a factor of,
73	let us say, three, we are left 
75	with a smaller copy of the original line. 

78	But we can put three of these copies together
82	to end up with the line that we first started with.

87	If we had shrank the line by a factor of 5,
90	we would have needed 5 smaller lines to recreate the original line
95	and so on and so forth. 

2_Square
00	What if we do the same for a two-dimensional square?

05	This time, shrinking each edge of the square by a factor of three,
10	we realise that we need more than three copies to rebuild the original.

15	In fact, we need nine copies to remake our original square. 

20	We have had to shrink both edges of the square, 
23	meaning that we need nine copies 
26	– or three to the power of two – to reconstruct the original.

3_CubeAndFractalInfo
00	One more example – how about a three-dimensional cube?

05	Once we shrink each edge by a factor of three,
09	we will need to stick 27 copies together to get back to where we started,
15	just like a Rubik’s cube.

17	This definition of dimension leads to an exciting possibility
23	– there are shapes for which the dimension isn’t a whole number at all!

27	For example, shapes called “fractals” can have a
30	dimension somewhere in between one and two, or two and three! 

4_SpongeIntroAndLevelOne
00	For the rest of this video,
1.5	we’re going to explore one example of a fractal
05	– a shape called the “Menger Sponge”. 

08	This shape has a dimension of around 2.727 and therefore
14	lives somewhere between two dimensions and three dimensions.

20	To make a Menger Sponge, let’s start off with our 3D cube.

25	We’re going to define a rule which we can apply
27	again and again to build our fractal.

30	As before, we can split the cube into 27 smaller copies of itself,
36	each three times smaller than the original, like a Rubik’s cube.

41	The rule which we’ll apply is to take away the
44	central cube from each of the six faces,
47	and the cube that’s left in the middle.

50	If we do this once we are left with a “level one” Menger Sponge.

56	This shape is made of 20 cubes, each one third the size of the original cube. 

5_LevelTwoAndAgainAndAgain
00	We can now apply our rule a second time,
04	to each of the 20 sub-cubes, to give a “level two” sponge.

10	This creates even more smaller cubes – 400, in fact!

15	We can apply the rule to each of these to get more cubes,
19	and repeat this again, and again, and again…

6_MengerSpongeDimension
00	The Menger Sponge is the name of the shape
04	that we’re left with if we apply this rule infinitely many times!

09	The Menger Sponge is made of 20 identical copies of itself,
13	each of them three times smaller than the original.

17	We can use the scaling definition of a dimension
20	that we saw earlier to find the dimension of the Menger Sponge.

24	We have to solve the equation 20 = 3^D,
29	which is true when D, the dimension, equals approximately 2.727!

7_ProceedWithCautionHighRes
00	We're going to take a trip around a level 5 Menger Sponge now
03	- if you suffer from motion sickness, please proceed with caution!

04	- if you suffer from motion sickness, please proceed with caution!

8_SomeUnusualProperties
00	As a 2.7 dimensional shape,
03	the Menger Sponge has some unusual properties.

06	For example, it has an infinite surface area,
09	but no volume at all, as every time we apply the rule
14	we increase the surface area and reduce the volume. 

8AndABit_Caveat
00	Of course, the shape we're currently looking at
03	isn't quite a true fractal
06	- here, if you look closely enough you can find solid walls.

10	In a true Menger Sponge,looking closely just reveals
14	an infinite number of smaller and smaller holes!

9_Finale
00	The Menger Sponge isn’t the only possible fractal
04	– in fact, the fractal dimension is a very good measure
08	of how complicated shapes are,
10	and has been used to describe everything from coastlines to cancer!
