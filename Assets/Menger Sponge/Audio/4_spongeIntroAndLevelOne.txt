00	For the rest of this video,
1.5	we’re going to explore one example of a fractal
05	– a shape called the “Menger Sponge”. 

08	This shape has a dimension of around 2.727 and therefore
14	lives somewhere between two dimensions and three dimensions.

20	To make a Menger Sponge, let’s start off with our 3D cube.

25	We’re going to define a rule which we can apply
27	again and again to build our fractal.

30	As before, we can split the cube into 27 smaller copies of itself,
36	each three times smaller than the original, like a Rubik’s cube.

41	The rule which we’ll apply is to take away the
44	central cube from each of the six faces,
47	and the cube that’s left in the middle.

50	If we do this once we are left with a “level one” Menger Sponge.

56	This shape is made of 20 cubes, each one third the size of the original cube.
