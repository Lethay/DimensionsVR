00	One more example – how about a three-dimensional cube?

05	Once we shrink each edge by a factor of three,
09	we will need to stick 27 copies together to get back to where we started,
15	just like a Rubik’s cube.

17	This definition of dimension leads to an exciting possibility
23	– there are shapes for which the dimension isn’t a whole number at all!

27	For example, shapes called “fractals” can have a
30	dimension somewhere in between one and two, or two and three!
