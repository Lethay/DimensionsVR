00	The Menger Sponge is the name of the shape
04	that weâ€™re left with if we apply this rule infinitely many times!

09	The Menger Sponge is made of 20 identical copies of itself,
13	each of them three times smaller than the original.

17	We can use the scaling definition of a dimension
20	that we saw earlier to find the dimension of the Menger Sponge.

24	We have to solve the equation 20 = 3^D,
29	which is true when D, the dimension, equals approximately 2.727!
