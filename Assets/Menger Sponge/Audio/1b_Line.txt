0	Take this straight line, for example. 

2	Lines, as you have seen earlier in the exhibition, are one dimensional. 

7	If we shrink this one-dimensional line by a factor of,
11	let us say, three, we are left 
13	with a smaller copy of the original line. 

16	But we can put three of these copies together
20	to end up with the line that we first started with.

25	If we had shrank the line by a factor of 5,
28	we would have needed 5 smaller lines to recreate the original line
33	and so on and so forth.
