00	What if we do the same for a two-dimensional square?

05	This time, shrinking each edge of the square by a factor of three,
10	we realise that we need more than three copies to rebuild the original.

15	In fact, we need nine copies to remake our original square. 

20	We have had to shrink both edges of the square, 
23	meaning that we need nine copies 
26	– or three to the power of two – to reconstruct the original.
