00	In this exhibition, you’ve seen a way that dimensions can be defined
04	in terms of the number of possible directions there are to move. 

09	But mathematically there are different ways of 
12	describing the idea of a dimension. 

15	One of them, the “fractal” dimension, 
18	uses the way that objects scale to define their dimension.

23	Here, we consider how many identical smaller copies of a shape are 
27	needed to recreate the original shape.

31	The equation you can see now describes this relationship.

35	The number of smaller copies needed 
38	is the same as the factor we have shrunk the shape by, 
42	raised to the power of the dimension 
45	– that is 2 for two dimensions, 3 for three dimensions
49	and so on and so forth. 

52	If a shape can be recreated from smaller copies of itself,
57	we can use this equation to find the fractal dimension.

61	Take this straight line, for example. 

64	Lines, as you have seen earlier in the exhibition, are one dimensional. 

69	If we shrink this one-dimensional line by a factor of,
73	let us say, three, we are left 
75	with a smaller copy of the original line. 

78	But we can put three of these copies together
82	to end up with the line that we first started with.

87	If we had shrank the line by a factor of 5,
90	we would have needed 5 smaller lines to recreate the original line
95	and so on and so forth.
